# Intelligent-Robotic-Hand
The task proposed in this project is to design an intelligent prosthetic hand. An intelligent prosthetic hand is defined as a hand that mimics the natural movements of the human hand.There are a lot of hazardous areas where humans need to work and especially their hand does most of the physical work. The basic idea of why we need a robotic hand that mimics human hand is to replace the human hand with this robotic hand to perform all the operations that human hand does with outstanding capabilities.They can be used in wide range of areas like industries,medical surgeries,human aid,Chemical laboratory Robotics etc
